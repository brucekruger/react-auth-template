# react-auth-template
Small examples of React authentication using CRA (both JS and TS). Auth servers are introduced by Express.js and ASP.NET Core API.
This is a rework of the samples from LinkedIn lesson: https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-authentication/.
Main UI application was also converted to use Typescript. Express.js authentication server's logic was ported to ASP.NET Core API.
